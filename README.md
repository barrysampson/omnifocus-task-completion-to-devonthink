# Omnifocus task completion report for DevonThink Pro

This script retrieves a list of OmniFocus tasks completed today, yesterday, this week, last week, or this month. It then summarizes the tasks in a new DevonThink note.

This script is a copy of the one written by [Ben Waldie](https://about.me/benwaldie) and posted to [Engadget](https://www.engadget.com/2013/02/18/applescripting-omnifocus-send-completed-task-report-to-evernot/). All I've done is modified it to send the compled note to DevonThink rather than Evernote and made some very minor tweaks to the HTML to suit my own preference.
